# Pset 1: Class Notes in HTML

Welcome to your first Catalyst PSET! We'll be honing our HTML skills.

## Instructions

Find some notes from a class you're taking right now. Now, your job is to convert those notes into HTML.

Edit `index.html` and add your class notes, making sure to use elements appropriately.

## Requirements
- At least three h1, h2, or h3 elements
- At least one bulleted or numbered list
- At least one image
    - Challenge: can you make this image in-line with the text, instead of breaking it up?
- At least one link to a website that would help you understand the material better
- Use bold, italics, and underlines in your text
