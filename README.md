# Pset 1: Class Notes in HTML

Welcome to your first Catalyst PSET! We'll be honing our HTML skills.

## Getting Started

First, as you did with the Catalyst learning interview, `git clone` this GitHub repository and open it up in VSCode or whichever code editor you prefer.

## Instructions

Find some notes from a class you're taking right now. Now, your job is to convert those notes into HTML.

Edit `index.html` and add your class notes, making sure to use elements appropriately.

## Requirements
- At least three h1, h2, or h3 elements
- At least one bulleted or numbered list
- At least one image
    - Challenge: can you make this image in-line with the text, instead of breaking it up?
- At least one link to a website that would help you understand the material better
- Use bold, italics, and underlines in your text

## Submission

Please make a screen recording through Zoom or any other screen-recording application of your choice. Walk us through both the code you wrote for this project as well as the visual output. Upload this video walkthrough to a video sharing service of your choice (unlisted YouTube video, Google Drive, etc.) and submit the share link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFjVA9YL9c1beaSARgmDG9oXkddgWYic4UlTe9Xrn5rlRxjw/viewform?usp=sf_link). This is all you have to do for the submission!
